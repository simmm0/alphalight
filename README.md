# Visual Stimuli: Alpha & Gamma

This is a simple web application designed for visual stimulation, allowing users to switch between two different flicker modes: **Alpha Mode (10Hz)** and **Gamma Mode (40Hz)**. The app now also includes a slider to transition smoothly between a bright, white light mode and a warm, incandescent/candlelight mode, similar to the functionality of the f.lux program.

## Features

- **Alpha Mode (10Hz):** Flicker at 10Hz, known as Alpha mode, which can be used for relaxation and mental clarity.
- **Gamma Mode (40Hz):** Flicker at 40Hz, known as Gamma mode, which may help in boosting creativity and focus.
- **Bright to Warm Light Transition:** Use the slider to adjust the light from bright white (daylight-like) to warm tones (similar to incandescent bulbs or candlelight).

## Usage

1. **Alpha Mode:** Click on the "Alpha Mode (10Hz)" button to activate the 10Hz flicker mode.
2. **Gamma Mode:** Click on the "Gamma Mode (40Hz)" button to switch to the 40Hz flicker mode.
3. **Adjusting the Light Mode:**
   - Use the "Adjust Mode" slider to transition between "Bright Mode" (leftmost position) and "Warm Mode" (rightmost position).
   - Intermediate positions on the slider will blend the two modes, allowing for customized light warmth.

## Getting Started

To use the app:

1. **Clone the repository** or download the `index.html` file.
2. **Open `index.html`** in any modern web browser.

Alternatively, you can access the app directly via GitHub Pages if hosted.

## Acknowledgments

This project was created as a simple tool for visual stimulation and is inspired by the use of flicker frequencies in relaxation and focus techniques. The addition of the brightness-to-warmth slider is inspired by the functionality of programs like f.lux.
